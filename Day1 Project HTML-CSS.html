        <h1> ESSENCE OF DANCE </h1>   
        <p>
            Imagine if every time you spun around it was as if you were walking in circles without it ever surmounting into a twirl. For some of us dance has been our only outlet, but at several instances throughout history, dance either did not exist or was banned.
            The grace involved with dance allows us to relieve ourselves from the stress around us so we can focus on the process of letting go.
            Dancing allows us to let go of the reality around us and transcend into a world of our own, away from the hardships and struggles involved with everyday life.

            Dating back to the Middle Ages, and even today, dancing is banned on religious holidays that are meant for mourning or contemplation. In fact, dancing on Good Friday is illegal in 13 of Germany’s total 16 states. While people will not be arrested for dancing, venues that host events in which dancing or celebration are involved can be fined with over 1000 Euros. In Indian history as well, many forms of dancing were frowned upon or banned as they were thought to be promiscuous. In Sweden, even today public dancing is forbidden regardless of the season. Many even say that tapping your feet to music is illegal. As for Japan, since the 1940s dancing at nightclubs transformed into hotbeds for prostitution and thus dancing is viewed very negatively by many of the country’s officials. Furthermore, dancing after midnight was banned for 67 years after the end of World War II, and it was only recently, in the June of 2015 that this ban was lifted. In Kuwait, there is still a very strict policy for behavior in concert scenarios in which barely any movement is allowed aside from clapping one’s hands and swaying slightly. In 2012, the Taliban massacred 17 innocent men at a party in Afghanistan because they were listening to music and dancing. Even today, due to the Taliban many Islamic countries have forbade their women from dancing although in modern times most other countries have rid themselves of these laws.
